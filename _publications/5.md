This paper presents an intelligent technique for classifying English, Arabic, and Dutch texts as checkworthy,
harnessing the power of the BERT-based model. The study explores ten baseline models, including LR, MNB, SVM,
CNN+LSTM, CNN+BiLSTM, BERT-Base-Uncased, RoBERTa, AraBERTv2, Dutch-RoBERTa, and Dutch-BERT,
to address the shared task. The study also investigates an LLM using few-shots, such as SetFit, to identify
checkworthy tweets or texts. Evaluation results unequivocally demonstrate the superiority of transformer-based
models, with RoBERTa achieving the highest F1 scores of 75.82% for English tweets, Dehate-BERT scoring 52.55%
for Arabic texts, and Dutch-BERT obtaining a maximum score of 58.42% for Dutch texts. Our team ranked 6th
overall for English, 5th for Arabic, and 16th for Dutch in the shared task challenge.
