I am a 4th-year CS undergraduate at CUET. I am proactive, focused, and passionate about exploring new technologies. I am enthusiastic about Multilingual and Multimodal NLP research. I am interested in exploring how existing resources of resource-rich languages can be effectively utilized to develop multilingual tools focusing on improving efficiency for low/zero-resource languages.
