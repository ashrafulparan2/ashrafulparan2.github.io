I am a 4th-year CS undergraduate at CUET. I am proactive, focused, and passionate about exploring new technologies. I am enthusiastic about Multilingual and Multimodal NLP research. I am interested in exploring how existing resources of resource-rich languages can be effectively utilized to develop multilingual tools focusing on improving efficiency for low/zero-resource languages.

I am pursuing my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from CUET under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=srYxYhcAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2"> Dr. Moshiul Hoque</a> as a member of the CUET NLP Lab. Besides research, I love to work with Data structures and Algorithms. Throughout my academic career, I have participated in ICPC, IUPC, and numerous national-level programming contests. While working on academic and extracurricular projects, I develop my skills in C, C++, Python, Java, and Latex. Working on several group projects helped me develop communication and planning skills.
