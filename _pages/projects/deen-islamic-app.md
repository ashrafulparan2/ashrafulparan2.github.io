## Splash Screen
Splash screens provide a simple initial experience while Android app loads. They set the stage
of an application, while allowing time for the app engine to load the application. Our app also
includes a splash screen. Through splash screen users can anticipate a smooth transition, setting
the stage for an optimal and engaging app experience.

## User Tracker
This special feature requires user registration, ensuring exclusive access to a unique page
within our application. This special page employs an innovative approach, revealing the
anonymous locations of all users on a map. This strategic use of geo locator library offers users
a comprehensive overview of the crowd density around mosques, facilitating a better
understanding of potential congestion. The functionality of this page is made possible by the
seamless integration of geo locator services. During the user's login process, the application
captures and stores their location information, ensuring real-time accuracy. This gathered data
is then securely transmitted to the database, forming the foundation for the dynamic display of
user locations on the dedicated page. By leveraging the power of geo locator library, our
application goes beyond conventional offerings, empowering users with a practical tool to
measure crowd levels around mosques. This unique feature not only enhances user engagement
but also contributes to a more informed and efficient navigation experience, aligning with our
commitment to providing innovative solutions within the realm of our application.
